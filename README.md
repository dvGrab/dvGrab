# Hacking the universe. Â°âœ©â‚ŠðŸŒ™âœ§Ë–Â°.â˜¾Ëš. âœ¦.Ë³

I'm an IT administrator of an educational service provider. I love to develop with Typescript and building backends. I do like to reverse engineer and analyse binaries of the Windows platform. I'm focusing on investigating games to develop extensions or addons for specific game genres. I do like to develop, but would also like to work for anti cheat providers. 

**Everything that is related to IT.**
